Realtime Game Portal is a full-stack web application enabling users to play multiple real-time games such as Callbreak, Hearts, and memory-based puzzles. Built with React and Vite on the frontend and Node.js with Express and Socket.io on the backend, the portal provides an interactive, responsive, and cross-platform compatible user interface. Players can log in, compete with others, and track their scores on live leaderboards. Real-time gameplay is powered by WebSockets, ensuring seamless communication between clients and server. The frontend is designed with modular components, routing, and animations via Framer Motion, while the backend efficiently handles game events and broadcasting moves to all connected players. The project emphasizes clean architecture, maintainable code, and easy extensibility for adding new games. It is fully deployable on platforms like Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend), making it production-ready and ideal for showcasing skills in full-stack development, real-time systems, and modern web technologies.
